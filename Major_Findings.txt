GENERAL DEMOGRAPHICS:
- Sex is the most consistently reported demographic, as only 0.04% of values were Not Reported.
- Over 600,000 drivers in our dataset had missing values for Race/Ethnicity. This indicates that our dataset cannot portray the entire reality of traffic stops in Chicago. A possible solution to this would be to audit officer reports to ensure that all information is being collected.
- In Chicago, traffic stops occur overwhelmingly most often for male drivers. Source: Sex.png
- Traffic stops occur most often for drivers who are 25-34 years of age. We can fairly safely assume that this is the most accurate demographic data, since officers will have a driver's age available on their license. Source: Age.png
- Black and Hispanic/Latinx drivers were stopped more often than white drivers. These driver demographics do not reflect the demographics of Chicago. According to Census.gov population estimates, the population of Chicago is approximately, 33% Non-hispanic white, 29% Black, and 29% Hispanic/Latinx. If traffic stops were reflective of the population, the bars would be approximately equal in size. Source: Race_Ethnicity.png


LOCATION DATA:
- There are hotspots for stops along the lakefront and near Oak Park.  
- The South Side also has a higher density of stops.
- A closer examination using the bar chart, "Stops by Neighborhood in Chicago," reveals that stops are disproportionately made on the South Side, where almost half of all stops are made. We also found the number of stops made downtown to be surprisingly small, though this could be due to the size of downtown compared to other areas defined.



MOST COMMON TIME POINTS FOR STOP TO OCCUR:



DEMOGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS:
- White officers represented over half the entire police force, while black & hispanic drivers were involved in over â…” of the incidents reported.
- White officers overwhelmingly arrested more hispanic & black drivers (about half as many white as black drivers).
- Black officers overwhelmingly arrested more black drivers.
- Hispanic officers arrested significantly more black & hispanic drivers.
- The proportion of hispanic & white reported crimes were substantially less for black officers than those of white officers. 


HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO STANDFORD'S FINDINGS IN THE OVERALL DATASET?
- Stanford found that Black drivers were stopped more often than white drivers, but Hispanic/Latinx drivers were stopped less often than white drivers.
- After controlling for other demographics and time and location, Black and Hispanic/Latinx drivers were more likely to be ticketed, searched, and arrested compared to white drivers.
- Threshold analysis indicated that Black and Hispanic/Latinx drivers were searched on the basis of less evidence than white drivers.



LIMITATIONS:
- This is an incomplete dataset, as it had many missing variables, and is reflective of the issues the Stanford Open Policing Report encountered. They filed public record requests with all 50 states, were able to collect data from 31 states, and 20 of those states provided enough detail to analyze racial disparities
